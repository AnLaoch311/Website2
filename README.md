   <p>     Ronan Lai grinned in awe with his arms outstretched and his chin held high. His bare body was sprayed by the sea as it crashed upon the cragged rocks he stood on. A great city roared behind him, but all that laid ahead of him was the sea. He lowered his arms and his head, but the grin remained. Staring at the island in the distance, he took slow steps forward and then dove silently into the cool water. His shoulders and arms stretched toward the sky and then back into the water without making a splash. It was under the water that his thrust was produced, his outstreched hands violently pushed the ocean behind him, only to reemerge into the air with no sign of their power. He was only meters away until he saw the sheer cliff that was his destination. He scaled the wall with ease and confidence. His hands grabbed the base of small tree and he hoisted himself up. His bare feet walked upon the moist soil of the island until he reached the peak. On a patch of grass only as large as his body, he lied down, satisfied with his exertion. </p>
     <p>     His eyes had been heavy and his mind restless a few hours before, but now his eyes were wide and mind was clear. Today he had commited to a mission which would present him with great challenges to come, and this brought him peace. His earlier anxiety had come from the awareness of his desires, but his fear that he may not act on them. His current confidence was becuase he had done what he wanted and he knew he would continue to. </p>
